# Baseline browser compatibility

We **must** provide browser compatability as per our client-facing [Browser Support](https://whitespacers.com/browser-support) documentation.

In all cases, _progressive enhancement_ will be employed in order to provide functionality where it is supported without degrading the overall user experience.
