# Project documentation standards

## README
A standard README format **must** be followed for all new web-based projects. There is a [boilerplate](/Resources/README-Boilerplate.md) for this README format.

Much of the information within the README will be proprietory and/or confidential so once created, they **must not** be hosted publicly unless prior arrangements with the development coordinators and/or client have been made.

## Documenting code
The following documentation standards **must** be followed when documenting within code:

 - JavaScript (ES5+) - [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org)
 - PHP - [PHPDoc](https://phpdoc.org)
