# HTML standards
> Part of [Coding](/Coding/Index.md) / [Languages](/Coding/Languages/Index.md)

When working with HTML, there are only a few broad standards we work towards:

 1. That all HTML is of type HTML5 (`<!DOCTYPE html>`).
 2. That any HTML created is validated using the w3 validator (https://validator.w3.org) either by URI or direct input.
 3. That only standard components are used where possible and that elements are not used for purposes other than intended.
